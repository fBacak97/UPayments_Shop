# UPayments Shop
# Running Dev Environment

- yarn install
- yarn start

This will open up your default browser, relocate to URL http://localhost:3000 and you will be able to use development environment of UPaymentsShop.

# Running Production Build

First, build the frontend;

- yarn install
- yarn run build

Normally you'd have to serve the static files from your server at this point but since this project doesn't require any backend I'll omit actually running the production build.
